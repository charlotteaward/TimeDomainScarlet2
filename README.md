# TimeDomainScarlet2
We provide example notebooks for the methodologies demonstrated in the Time-domain Scarlet2 paper. The imaging data for one of the simulated supernovae is available in the data/ directory. The imaging data for the full suite of simulated supernovae, the ZTF TDEs and the HSC AGN can be provided upon request. These notebooks run on the version of Scarlet2 from #Commit: 42dd7da (https://github.com/pmelchior/scarlet2/commit/42dd7da89848fe8fc80e8d5ca6a4351c891acc4b).
